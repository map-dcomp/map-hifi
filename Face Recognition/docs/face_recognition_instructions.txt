Running the server:

2. Execute a command with the following format:
java -jar build/libs/FaceDetectionServer.jar [port] [image output folder]

Example:
java -jar build/libs/FaceDetectionServer.jar 7123 face_output


Running a client:

1. Create a folder to contain images that the client will send to the server for analysis.

2. Place images into the folder. The client will find and send images at any level of depth in the file structure within the folder.

3. Execute a command with the following format:
java -jar build/libs/ImageSendingClient.jar [server address] [server port] [image input folder]

Example:
java -jar build/libs/ImageSendingClient.jar localHost 7123 face_input
