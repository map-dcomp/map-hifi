1. Install a virtual machine with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. You can downlad the ISO here:
https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop


2. Install java on the VM. You can use the install_java.sh script to install the latest version of JDK 8.

Here is the information for the Java version that I have installed:
java version "1.8.0_144"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_144-b01)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)


3. Ensure that the version of java that you installed is selected on the system. You can use the java_update_alternatives.sh script,
which contains the command to switch the selected java version for the system.


4. Install git on the VM. You can use the install_git.sh script.

5. To setup specific components of the test bed, follow the setup instructions a component's "docs" folder.
Current Components:
Face Recognition - example application to be tested
Testing Harness - a program that facilitates the testing and analysis of example applications
