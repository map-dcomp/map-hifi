This scenario is the 15 node toplogy.
There is only 1 container allowed per NCP.
The simple webserver is service used.
The demand causes migration of the service from region X to another region.

DCOP algorithm: DISTRIBUTED_CONSTRAINT_DIFFUSION
RLG algorithm: BIN_PACKING

This scenario takes 28 nodes in emulab.
