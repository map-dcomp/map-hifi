Each region has a class C (/24 or 255.255.255.0) subnet.

The primary interface of a host is the interface that is connected to the regional subnet matching the region of the host.

Addresses 1-10 are for inter-regional connections. These are IP addresses for the non-primary interfaces on hosts.

11 - NCP 1
12,13,14,15 - containers on NCP 1
16 - NCP 2
17,18,19,20 - containers on NCP 2

200 - 253 - clients

This is coded into StageExperiment and the rules are codified in SubnetBlock in the stage-experiment project.
