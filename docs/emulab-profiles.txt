The file emulab-topology.py contains the code that should be pasted
into the profile on Emulab to create the desired topology.

When using an emulab profile you need to make sure to set the name of
the experiment when you instantiate it. On step 3 of the instatiation
there is the option to specify a name, you must put the name of the
scenario there, otherwise the hosts file for ansible will point to the
wrong systems and setup will fail.

A profile defines a topology.
Instantiating a profile creates an experiment.
So one can have multiple experiments based off of the same profile.
