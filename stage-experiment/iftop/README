iftop must be run as root.

KNOWN ISSUES

Solaris:

On Solaris, iftop has to run in promiscuous mode in order to capture
outgoing packets.  iftop autoconfigures to run in promiscuous mode on
Solaris, but will filter out non-broadcast packets which are not
addressed to or from localhost.  On Solaris, the -p option merely
disables that filter.

If you have some other sort of system that behaves like Solaris in
needing promiscuous mode, you can pass --enable-default-promiscuous to
configure to enable this behavior.

Cf. http://www.tcpdump.org/lists/workers/2002/02/msg00010.html

The version of curses distributed with Solaris may not be sufficient for
iftop's needs. You will probably need ncurses or similar.
